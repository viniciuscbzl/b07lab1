CSCB07 Lab 01

In this lab I created a class called Polynomial with one field, two constructors and three methods:

Field:
Polynomial P;

Constructor:
Polynomial P = new Polynomial();
Polynomial P = new Polynomial(double []A);

Methods:
P.add(Polynomial B) \\ add polynomials P and B
P.evaluate(double x) \\ evaluate P(x)
P.hasRoot(y) \\ dertermines if P(y)=0
